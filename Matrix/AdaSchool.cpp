// Ada's classroom contains Nâ‹…M tables distributed in a grid with N rows and M columns. Each table is occupied by exactly one student.

// Before starting the class, the teacher decided to shuffle the students a bit. After the shuffling, each table should be occupied by exactly one student again. In addition, each student should occupy a table that is adjacent to that student's original table, i.e. immediately to the left, right, top or bottom of that table.

// Is it possible for the students to shuffle while satisfying all conditions of the teacher?

// Sample Input 1 
// 2
// 3 3
// 4 4
// Sample Output 1 
// NO
// YES
